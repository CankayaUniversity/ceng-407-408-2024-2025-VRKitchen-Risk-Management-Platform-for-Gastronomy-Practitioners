# VRKitchen: Risk Management Platform for Gastronomy Practitioners

## Project Description

Cooking, an essential skill for gastronomy students, involves more than just the art of preparing delicious meals. It encompasses a range of activities
that may pose risks to safety, health, and business operations. Recognizing and managing these risks is crucial for aspiring chefs and culinary
professionals. These may range from Cross-contamination, Burns and scalds to Cross-contact of allergens and Equipment and Machinery Failures.
For gastronomy students, learning about the various risks associated with cooking and how to manage them is as important as mastering culinary
skills. Risk management is not just about avoiding problems; it’s about preparing aspiring chefs to handle unexpected challenges efficiently and
safely.

This project aims to develop a Virtual Reality (VR) environment for training gastronomy students on managing the risks associated with cooking.
The VR environment will simulate various dangerous situations that chefs commonly encounter, such as cross-contamination, burns, equipment
failure, and allergic reactions. By immersing students in a safe but realistic virtual kitchen, the training module will help them identify, understand,
and mitigate risks efficiently. The project will focus on creating scenarios that can be integrated into the curriculum for culinary students, emphasizing
both safety and the importance of professional standards in risk management.
